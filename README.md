Notepad is a basic text editing program included with Microsoft Windows, designed for creating and editing plain text files. It is commonly used for simple tasks such as writing notes, editing configuration files, or creating batch scripts. For example, users might use Notepad to save a to-do list as a ".txt" file, modify a ".cfg" file for software settings, or write a basic ".bat" script for automating tasks. Notepad does not support advanced formatting like bold or italics, making it ideal for working with unformatted text.

Notepad++ can occasionally exhibit glitches when handling files, where content beyond a certain point, such as line 200, may fail to display properly despite the line numbers being visible. This issue might stem from rendering problems, software bugs, or file-specific anomalies causing text to appear blank or missing in certain sections. Such behavior could disrupt workflows, especially when working with extensive code or text files, and may require troubleshooting steps like updating the software, adjusting settings, or verifying the file's integrity to resolve the issue.
