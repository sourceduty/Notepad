Notepad is a basic text editing program included with Microsoft Windows, designed for creating and editing plain text files. It is commonly used for simple tasks such as writing notes, editing configuration files, or creating batch scripts. For example, users might use Notepad to save a to-do list as a ".txt" file, modify a ".cfg" file for software settings, or write a basic ".bat" script for automating tasks. Notepad does not support advanced formatting like bold or italics, making it ideal for working with unformatted text.
